<button class="button" aria-label="View the details of Lorem Ipsum">View Details</button>

<!-- 
    The same markup can be used for <a>

    Be sure to add the property "aria-label" with a
    clear description when the text of the button
    isn't clear â€“ for instance on 'close'-buttons
    which only display an 'X'.
